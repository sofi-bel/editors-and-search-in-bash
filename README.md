# Assignment

                
1. Use the vi or nano file editor of your choice. In this assignment, you will need to do the work of writing code from the bash shell editor.
2. You already have several directories from the previous assignment that contain ```cherry_pie.sh``` files, go to any directory of your choice.
3. From that directory, run a search command for the same scripts and display the results. If you want, you can save this list for use in the next part of the assignment.
4. In the empty bash script (in the ```cherry_pie.sh``` script), make the changes as assigned:
         
    4.1. Look for all ```cherry_pie.sh``` files in all directories of the previous assignment (14 directories in total - i.e. 14 files).
    
    4.2. All empty found files (13 out of 14 will be empty, in the 14th one you will make changes according to the task). You should check if they are empty by going through the list of found files, are replaced by the given running script. **Note:** After the first successful run, the ```cherry_pie.sh``` scripts will not be empty anywhere in these 14 directories. So no copying should occur. Do not specify the hardcoded path of the script itself.
    
    4.3. In the root directory of the previous assignment, where the 14 directories are located, an entry is made in the ```white_lodge.txt``` file in the following form: ```<timestamp> <directory name (just the name of the directory itself, not the path)> ordered a cherry pie.``` **Example:** Dale ordered a cherry pie.
         
**Note:** This script will be copied into point 4.2, which means it must be implemented in a way so that if you copy the script to another directory, the logic of the script won't change. The previous entries are not erased. The report must show at least 3 runs - the original first one and from the other two directories. It is also necessary to demonstrate the contents of the ```white_lodge.txt``` file with at least 3 entries for different runs.
